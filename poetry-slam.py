# 1. You will store your poem in a .txt file. Feel free to use any poem of your choice!

# 2. Create a function called get_file_lines():

#     -It should have 1 parameter called filename, which is a string of the filename.
#     -It should return a list of strings containing the lines of the file.

def get_file_lines(filename):
    with open('poem.txt', 'r') as infile:
        poem_string = infile.read()
        return poem_string.split('\n')

# 3. Create a function called lines_printed_backwards():

#     -It should have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     -It should print the lines of the poem in reverse. Include the original line number at the beginning of each line.


def lines_printed_backwards(lines_list):
    for i in range(len(lines_list)):
        lines_list[i] = str(i) + '. ' + lines_list[i]
    lines_list.reverse()
    backwards_poem = '\n'.join(lines_list)
    print(backwards_poem)

lines_list = get_file_lines('poem.txt')
lines_printed_backwards(lines_list)

# 4. Create a function called lines_printed_random():

#     -It should have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     -It should print the lines of your poem in randomly order. Repeats are ok, but make sure the number of lines
#     printed is equal to the original lines in the poem(Line numbers do not need to be printed.) Hint: try
#     using a loop and randint() from the random module.


# def lines_printed_random(lines_list):
#     print()

# 5. Create a function called lines_printed_custom():

#     -It should minimally have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     -It should print the poem in a unique way, be creative!
#     -Make sure that you carefully comment your custom function so itâ€™s clear what it does.


# def lines_printed_custom(lines_list):
#     print()

# 6. Your final submitted code should use the four functions(get_file_lines(), lines_printed_backwards(), lines_printed_random(),
#    and lines_printed_custom()) you wrote. It should print out the poem contained in your text file backwards, random, and
#    custom to the terminal.
