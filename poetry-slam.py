# 1. You will store your poem in a .txt file. Feel free to use any poem of your choice!

# 2. Create a function called get_file_lines():

#     It should have 1 parameter called filename, which is a string of the filename.
#     It should return a list of strings containing the lines of the file.

# 3. Create a function called lines_printed_backwards():

#     It should have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     It should print the lines of the poem in reverse. Include the original line number at the beginning of each line.

# 4. Create a function called lines_printed_random():

#     It should have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     t should print the lines of your poem in randomly order. Repeats are ok, but make sure the number of lines printed is equal to the original lines in the poem(Line numbers do not need to be printed.) Hint: try using a loop and randint() from the random module.

# 5. Create a function called lines_printed_custom():

#     It should minimally have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     It should print the poem in a unique way, be creative!
#     Make sure that you carefully comment your custom function so itâ€™s clear what it does.

# 6. Your final submitted code should use the four functions(get_file_lines(), lines_printed_backwards(), lines_printed_random(), and lines_printed_custom()) you wrote. It should print out the poem contained in your text file backwards, random, and custom to the terminal.
