# 1. You will store your poem in a .txt file. Feel free to use any poem of your choice!

# filename = "poem.txt"
# infile = open(filename, "r")

# with open(poem.txt, 'r') as outfile:
#     outfile.write()

# 2. Create a function called get_file_lines():

#     It should have 1 parameter called filename, which is a string of the filename.
#     It should return a list of strings containing the lines of the file.


def get_file_lines(filename):
    return

# 3. Create a function called lines_printed_backwards():

#     It should have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     It should print the lines of the poem in reverse. Include the original line number at the beginning of each line.


def lines_printed_backwards()(lines_list):
    print()

# 4. Create a function called lines_printed_random():

#     It should have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     It should print the lines of your poem in randomly order. Repeats are ok, but make sure the number of lines 
#     printed is equal to the original lines in the poem(Line numbers do not need to be printed.) Hint: try 
#     using a loop and randint() from the random module.

def lines_printed_random(lines_list):
    print()

# 5. Create a function called lines_printed_custom():

#     It should minimally have 1 parameter called lines_list, which is a list of strings containing lines of your poem.
#     It should print the poem in a unique way, be creative!
#     Make sure that you carefully comment your custom function so itâ€™s clear what it does.

def lines_printed_custom(lines_list):
    print()

# 6. Your final submitted code should use the four functions(get_file_lines(), lines_printed_backwards(), lines_printed_random(),
#    and lines_printed_custom()) you wrote. It should print out the poem contained in your text file backwards, random, and 
#    custom to the terminal.
